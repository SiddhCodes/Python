'''Tuple Powers'''
# Before starting we need to understand some of the terminology.
'''Immutable'''
# Tuples are not mutable you cannot change the values of tuple
'''Duplicate'''
# You can have duplicate values in tuple there are no restriction
'''Ordered'''
# Set are ordered and you can access them through index values
'''Heterogenous'''
# Set also have heterogenous nature and can have different types of data structure in tuple.

'''Tuple Traversing and methods'''
# Tuples are traversed in the same manner as List are traversed
# But remember tuples are like strings you can’t change anything once it’s made we can’t change them
# Well the use case is not much in question solving but still you have to understand it
# Methods of tuple are:
t = (1,2,3,4,5) # initial tuple
index = t.index(2) # returns the index of the first occurrence of 2 in the tuple
count_5 = t.count(5) # returns the count occurrence of 5 in the tuple
# Yes there are only 2 methods of tuple one for finding the index and other of counting the occurrences of an element.
