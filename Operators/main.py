'''What are operators'''
#  Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Python has  types of operators for different tasks like arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more
# Lets see every operators one by one

'''Arithmetic operators'''
# Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc

# There are 7 types of arithmetic operator.
# addition         +                      
# subtraction      -                    
# multiplication   *                    
# division         /                      
# Floor division   //                    
# modulus          %
# Exponentiation   **

# Eg - a = 12 
# b = 8
# print(a+b)
# Output - 20

'''Assignment operator'''
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Python also provides compound assignment operators that perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc
# A basic assignment operator is simple =.

'''Compound assignment operator'''
# Compound assignment operator combines arithmetic operations with assignment
# But first you have to understand how things work when we reassign variables in python and also reassigning variables with addition, subtraction etc.
# Using compound assignment operators the reassigning works better

# +=      Add and assig
# -=      Subtract and assig                                        
# *=      Multiply and assign                                        
# /=      Divide and assig                                        
# //=     Floor divide and assig                                      
# %=      modulus and assig                                      
# **=     Exponentiation and assign                                        

'''Comparison operator'''
# Comparison operators, also called relational operators, are used to compare two values
# Comparison operators will always provide Boolean result that is True and False
# omparison operators are as follows

# ==    Equal to                                     
# !=    Not Equal to                                      
# >     Greater than                                      
# <     Less than                                      
# >=    Greater than or equal to                                     
# <=    Less than or equal to

#  Comparison operators will work with numbers but you can use them with strings as well.
# Strings will be comparing the Ascii values of string.                                  
# 

'''Logical operators'''
# Logical operators in Python are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean result (True or False)
# There are 3 types of logical operator
# and   - Return True if both condition are True
# or      - Return True if at least one condition is True
# not    - Reverse the boolean value

'''Trivial Questions'''
# Answer True and Fals
# Print(126 > 130
# print((456 == 456) != (235 == 236)
# print(12 < 10 or 45 == 56 or 69 > 70 or 15 != 13
# print(True and bool(0))
