'''In-build data structures'''
# Data structures are used to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently. Python provides several built-in data structures
# And for storing multiple values we will again use variables
# Now in python we have 4 types of in-build data structure List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set
'''Custom data structures'''
# Now there are some custom data structures as well like Stack, Queue, Linked List, Graph etc
# And around these data structures there are some algorithms like searching algorithms, sorting algorithms
# And this is why the study is called data structures and algorithm
# Lets be clear this python notes are not for the DSA this will cover all the in-build data structures.
