'''Conditional statements'''
# Conditional statements in Python allow decision-making by executing different blocks of code based on conditions
# Decision making can be understood with an example 

# eg - you will receive a number from the user if the number is 
# greater than 10 you will do task A and lower than 10 you 
# will do task B

# Here the situation is simple Number will decide which task will be executed
# That means now we will control the flow of our program based on some conditions thats why these statements are also known as control flow statement.

'''Types of conditional statements'''
# Generally there are 3 types of variation in conditional statements
#  For syntax you have to watch the video for better understanding

#  if             -  Executes if the condition is True              
# if-else         -  Executes if True, # another if Fals         
# if-elif-else    -  Checks multiple condition in sequence

'''if'''
# if condition :
    # code to be executed if condition is true

'''if-else'''
# if condition:
#     code to be executed if condition is true
# else:
#     code to be executed if condition is false

'''if-elif-else'''
# if condition:
#     code to be executed if condition is true
# elif condition:
#     code to be executed if condition is true
# else:
#     code to be executed if condition is false

'''If- elif ladder'''
# You cna also create if elif ladder using multiple conditions of elif.
# For understanding solve this question
# take the input of temperature in celsius
# Below 0°C → "Freezing Cold 
# 0°C to 10°C → "Very Cold 
# 10°C to 20°C → "Cold 
# 20°C to 30°C → "Pleasant 
# 30°C to 40°C → "Hot 
# Above 40°C → "Very Hot "
