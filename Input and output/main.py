'''Output'''
# You probably know till now, how to provide the output of the code you have written and that is with print() function.
# There is no other functions to provide the result on the terminal we just have to use print() function
# Now when providing the output we can use variables in print statement using a formatted string as shown in the below example
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello {name} ! Welcome to Python programing.")

'''Input'''
# But the main question is how to ask user for some information.
# For example there is a user and you want to ask the age of that user, how can you do so, it’s easy using input().
# Now the default data type of input is always string reason is simple you can store anything in string.
# You have to manually convert the data type of input statements.
